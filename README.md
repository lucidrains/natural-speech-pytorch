## Natural Speech - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of the neural network proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04421">Natural Speech</a>, a text-to-speech generator that is indistinguishable from human recordings for the first time. The novelty of the paper includes a differentiable duration predictor module, a bidirectional prior / posterior, as well as attending to a set of learned memories.
